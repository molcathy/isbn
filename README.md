# isbn

Write a program which:
* inputs 12 digits of an ISBN as integers (this can be done with 12 input statements if you like)
* it will then:
    - multiply each of the digits by 1 or 3 as appropriate
    - add up the total
    - then find the remainder when divided by ten (remember to use the % symbol)
    - finally subtracting remainder from 10. There will need to be a final if statement at the end.

Test your program with the following ISBNs:
* 978110754673
* 978191052307

Screenshot your program code and the output for both the ISBNs.
